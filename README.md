# Python-for-Genomic-Data-Science-on Coursera

I developed a python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences and :

i.)    checks file records

ii.)   computes the length of each DNA sequence 

iii.)  identifies open reading frames in each DNA sequence 

iv.)   identifies repeated motifs in DNA sequences
